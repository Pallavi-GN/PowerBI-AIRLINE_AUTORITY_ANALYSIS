# PowerBI-AIRLINE_AUTORITY_ANALYSIS

## Introduction
This document provides a simplified guide for conducting Airline autority analysis using Power BI.

## Data Sources
Airline Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis "Airline_autority_data" excel file.

## Data Fields
1.Airline Name: Name of the airline operating the flight.

2.Month: Month in which the flight occurred.

3.Week: Week categorization based on flight dates.

4.Status: Flight status, categorized as "Delayed," "On-time," or "Canceled."

5.Average Delay Time: Average delay time for each airline.

6.Departure Hour: Hour of the day when the flight departed.

## Data Import and Cleaning
The dataset was imported from an Excel file, and a comprehensive data cleaning process was implemented to address any inconsistencies or missing values. This step ensures the reliability of the data for accurate analysis.

## Visualization Components
1. Slicers
Interactive slicers have been implemented to allow users to filter data based on the airline name and month, providing a more personalized and focused analysis.

2. Clustered Bar Chart - Week Analysis
A clustered bar chart has been utilized to visually represent the performance of airlines on a weekly basis, categorizing flights as delayed, on-time, or canceled. This provides a clear overview of the airline's punctuality throughout the month.

3. Stacked Column Chart - Airline Average Delay Time
The stacked column chart showcases the average delay time for each airline, enabling a comparison of performance in terms of delays. This visual aid helps identify airlines with consistently better or worse punctuality.

4. Pie Chart - Flight Status Distribution
A pie chart illustrates the distribution of flights by status â€“ on-time, delayed, or canceled. This provides a quick overview of the overall performance of the airlines in terms of adherence to schedules.

5. Stacked Column Chart - Departure Hour Analysis
A stacked column chart represents the distribution of flights by departure hour, allowing for insights into peak hours and potential correlations between specific time slots and delays.

## Conclusion
This Power BI project offers a comprehensive analysis of airline performance, utilizing visualizations that provide both high-level overviews and detailed insights. Stakeholders and decision-makers can use this analysis to identify patterns, areas for improvement, and make data-driven decisions to enhance airline operations.
